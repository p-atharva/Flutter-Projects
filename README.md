# Flutter-Projects
<p>This Repository Contains a Few Flutter Projects.<br>
  
I Love creating Apps, and Flutter is a very powerful framework for doing so.<br>
I started My Journey by using basic and simple architectures and components to build Apps. :technologist:<br> 
This repository has projects increasing in complexity and complex architectures as they are numbered.<be> 

(PS: UI doesn't showcase complexity, and there are a lot of things going on behind the scenes)<br>
